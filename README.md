## 📦 Installation

1. Place the folder `practiceutils` in your `csgo/cfg/` directory.
2. Adjust settings in `practiceutils/settings.cfg` (global settings) and optionally create map‑specific spawn configs in `practiceutils/maps/` (see [Spawn Management](#-spawn-management) below).
3. Add the following to your **launch options**: `-disable_workshop_command_filtering +exec "practiceutils/main"`(`-disable_workshop_command_filtering` is required for the cfg to work on workshop maps.)
4. Enter an offline map and type the following into the console: `+practiceutils`

## 🧭 Spawn Management

Spawn squares are defined in **map‑specific configuration files**.

### 📁 Map Config Files
Place a file named `<mapname>.cfg` in `cfg/practiceutils/maps/` (e.g., `de_mirage.cfg`). The script executes this file on map load.

### ✏️ Syntax: `settings --addspawn`
`settings --addspawn { label "..." id "..." origin "x y z" angles "pitch yaw roll" color "r g b a" idangle "pitch yaw roll" idcolor "r g b a" }`

**Required fields:**
- `label` – the name shown on the spawn square (e.g., `"[T] Spawn"`).
- `id` – a number (e.g., `"1"`) displayed on the square.
- `origin` – three space‑separated floats: `x y z`.
- `angles` – three space‑separated floats: `pitch yaw roll` (for the player's view angle).
- `color` – four space‑separated integers: `r g b a` (0–255).

**Optional fields:**
- `idangle` – three space‑separated floats: `pitch yaw roll` – rotation of the ID text on the square (default: `0 90 0`).
- `idcolor` – four space‑separated integers: `r g b a` – color of the ID text (default: same as `color` but with alpha `100`).

**Example:**
`settings --addspawn { label "[T] Spawn" id "1" origin "-2994 1312 -127.07091522216797" angles "0 -26.99993896484375 0" color "222 155 53 255" idangle "0 90 0" idcolor "222 155 53 100" }`


### 🔁 Fallback
If no custom spawns are defined for a map, the script automatically generates spawns from `info_player_terrorist` and `info_player_counterterrorist` entities. You can still use `listspawns` to see them.

## 🧠 Usage Tips

- **Interactive Menus** – many features (like `loadpos` and `lineup_menu`) use HUD hints. Use `menu_up`/`menu_down` to navigate, and `USE`/`RELOAD`/`INSPECT` to interact.
- **Scanning** – define at least one zone with `lineup_target`, then run `lineup_scan`. The script will freeze you, simulate many throws, and show results.
- **Custom Spawns** – create a map‑specific `.cfg` in `practiceutils/maps/` to define your own spawn points. The script loads them on map start.
- **Bots** – use `placebots` to position bots on your saved spots for testing nades or angles.
- **Cleanup** – run `-practiceutils` to cleanly remove the script without restarting the map.
